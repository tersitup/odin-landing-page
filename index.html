            <h2>A Popular Quote</h2>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.scarymommy.com/parks-and-recreation-quotes/">“I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks. I didn’t actually sell my car, I just forgot where I parked it. I don’t know who Al Gore is, and at this point, I’m too afraid to ask. When they say two percent milk, I don’t know what the other 98 percent is. When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me. I once threw beer at a swan and then it attacked my niece, Rebecca.” — Andy Dwyer</blockquote>
